# date-differ
#### Building date differ without using inbuilt libraries
The app reads from data.txt a single string of the format  `DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY` and outputs the result as `DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY, difference`. The app also limits the input range of dates from 1900 to 2010.

## Setting the app
```shell
npm install
```

## Running the app
```shell
npm run app
```
## Running the tests
```shell
npm run tests
```
